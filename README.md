# Eyes Exercise
<img src=./eyes.png>

## Description:
<p> The eyes will follow the curser as you move it around the screen. <br> This activity showcases the integration of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. </p>

## How to Run:
<p> Clone all files to a single folder. <br> Open the "index.html" folder in your browser. <br> Move your cursor around the page and while the yes follow it. </p>

## Future Improvements:
<p> I plan to add a picture to the background so that the eyes look like part of a face. <br> I plan to add JavaScript so that if the user clicks the eyes will freeze in place and another click will make them move again. </p>
